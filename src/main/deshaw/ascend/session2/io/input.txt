In 2020, D. E. Shaw India introduced DESIS Ascendâ€”a diversity, equity, and
inclusion initiative-to cultivate an environment of continuous learning and
development that enables exceptional people to do their best work. The first
edition of the DESIS Ascend Fellowship for Women in Tech was conducted
virtually in October 2020 as a three-day program, with fellows taking part in a
series of unique educational experiences providing exposure to the corporate
world and to our work.
